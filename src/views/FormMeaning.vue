            <h2>Overview of Form and Meaning Integration (形义结合概述)</h2>
            <p>Form and Meaning Integration (形义结合) is an important principle in traditional Chinese naming theory, emphasizing the harmonious unity between the aesthetic form of characters and their semantic connotations. Chinese characters, as ideographic writing, possess not only pronunciation and meaning but also unique structural aesthetics and visual artistic value. An ideal name should be visually balanced in character structure while being profound and appropriate in meaning, with both aspects complementing and enhancing each other.</p>
            <p>Since ancient times, Chinese people have valued "unity of form and spirit" (形神兼备) in naming, meaning that a name should not only contain auspicious meanings but also be aesthetically pleasing when written. Especially among scholars and literati, names were often viewed as works of art, pursuing the perfect unity of structural beauty and profound meaning.</p>

          <h2>Character Structure Aesthetics (汉字结构美学)</h2>
          <p>The aesthetic balance of Chinese character structure is an important element of Form and Meaning Integration. A beautiful name should present harmonic and balanced structural beauty visually.</p>

              <h3>Chinese Character Structure Classification (汉字结构分类)</h3>
              <p>The basic structure types of Chinese characters include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-component characters (独体字): </strong>Such as "人, 山, 水", with simple structure and relatively few strokes</li>
                <li><strong>Left-right structure (左右结构): </strong>Such as "好, 明, 清", with two components arranged side by side</li>
                <li><strong>Top-bottom structure (上下结构): </strong>Such as "字, 安, 室", with two components arranged vertically</li>
                <li><strong>Semi-enclosure structure (半包围结构): </strong>Such as "问, 同, 闻", with one component surrounding three sides of another</li>
                <li><strong>Full enclosure structure (全包围结构): </strong>Such as "国, 围, 圆", with one component completely surrounding another</li>
                <li><strong>Three-component structure (品字结构): </strong>Such as "品, 森, 晶", with three components arranged in a triangular pattern</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When naming, one can choose characters for the given name based on the structural characteristics of the surname to achieve good visual balance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="structure-card">
              <h3>Principles of Structural Balance (结构平衡原则)</h3>
              <p>The basic principles of structural balance in Chinese characters include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Symmetrical balance (对称平衡): </strong>The character's overall form presents a visual sense of left-right or top-bottom symmetry</li>
                <li><strong>Even distribution (均衡分布): </strong>The strokes are evenly distributed in space, avoiding excessive concentration or sparseness</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate density (疏密适中): </strong>The density of strokes is moderate, neither too crowded nor too sparse</li>
                <li><strong>Structural coordination (结构协调): </strong>Different structure types combined to create visual rhythm</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, if the surname has a left-right structure (such as "刘" Liu), the given name can use characters with a top-bottom structure (such as "安" An) to create structural variation and balance.</p>

          <h2>Stroke Aesthetics and Balance (笔画美学与平衡)</h2>
          <p>Besides the overall structure, the number and distribution of strokes in Chinese characters also affect the visual aesthetics of names. Stroke aesthetics emphasizes creating harmonious visual rhythm in names.</p>
          
          <div class="strokes-wrapper">
            <div class="stroke-card">
              <h3>Stroke Count Balance (笔画数量平衡)</h3>
              <p>Balance in stroke counts considers the following aspects:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance of simplicity and complexity (简繁相济): </strong>Combining simple characters (few strokes) with complex ones (many strokes), avoiding the thinness of all simple characters or the heaviness of all complex characters</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive arrangement (渐进式搭配): </strong>Stroke counts showing a pattern of change, such as increasing or decreasing, creating visual rhythm</li>
                <li><strong>Overall balance with surname (姓名总体平衡): </strong>Considering the stroke count of the surname, the stroke count of the given name should form an overall balance</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, if a surname has many strokes (such as "黄" Huang, 12 strokes), the given name can use characters with fewer strokes (such as "力" Li, 2 strokes) and moderate strokes (such as "文" Wen, 4 strokes), forming "黄力文" (Huang Li Wen), showing a rhythm of many-few-moderate strokes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="stroke-card">
              <h3>Stroke Fluidity (笔画流畅性)</h3>
              <p>The fluidity of strokes affects the overall aesthetics of names:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fluid lines (线条流畅): </strong>Choosing characters with fluid, naturally written strokes</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate turns (转折适度): </strong>Avoiding too many sharp turns or complex crossings in strokes</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial resonance (空间呼应): </strong>The stroke directions between characters form resonance or complementation</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the character "云" (cloud) has mainly curved strokes, flowing and elegant; the character "山" (mountain) has mainly straight strokes, upright and powerful. Combined as "云山" (Yun Shan), they create a visual beauty of curved and straight integration.</p>

          <h2>Character Meaning and Pictographic Quality (字义内涵与象形)</h2>
          <p>The semantic connotations of Chinese characters often have intrinsic connections with their forms, especially in pictographic and ideographic characters. An ideal name should establish a harmonious relationship between character form and meaning.</p>
          
          <div class="meaning-wrapper">
            <div class="meaning-card">
              <h3>Pictographic Quality and Imagery (象形性与意象)</h3>
              <p>Many Chinese characters retain their pictographic features and can evoke specific visual imagery:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural pictographs (自然象形): </strong>Such as "山, 水, 木, 火, 日, 月", directly depicting natural objects</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic pictographs (动态象形): </strong>Such as "飞, 跃, 流, 升", expressing dynamic characteristics</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract pictographs (抽象象形): </strong>Such as "永, 心, 思", abstract expression of ideas</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When naming, one can choose characters with distinctive pictographic features to give the name vivid imagery. For example, in the name "林泽" (Lin Ze), "林" has two "木" (tree) side by side, symbolizing luxuriance; "泽" has a water radical, representing extensive water or wetlands. Together, they combine visual imagery with rich connotations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="meaning-card">
              <h3>Semantic Connections and Layers (字义关联与层次)</h3>
              <p>The associations and layering of character meanings are also important aspects of Form and Meaning Integration:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Semantic coherence (义理相通): </strong>Characters in a name share related meanings, forming internal connections</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic complementation (义理互补): </strong>Different character meanings form complementary relationships, enhancing each other</li>
                <li><strong>Metaphorical connection (隐喻关联): </strong>Establishing deeper connections between character meanings through metaphor or association</li>
                <li><strong>Form-meaning resonance (字形字义呼应): </strong>A character's form resonates with its meaning, strengthening the expressive effect</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, in the name "德馨" (De Xin), "德" represents moral character, "馨" means fragrance, their meanings are related and complementary, symbolizing that virtue is as fragrant as a good scent; meanwhile, "馨" contains the "香" (fragrance) radical, showing high unity of form and meaning.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid excessive complexity: </strong>Don't choose overly complex characters, especially uncommon ones, which may have unique forms but are difficult to write and recognize</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid structural monotony: </strong>Avoid using all characters with the same structure, such as all left-right or all top-bottom structures</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid extreme stroke counts: </strong>Avoid using combinations of characters with too few strokes (appearing thin) or too many strokes (appearing heavy)</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid semantic disconnection: </strong>Avoid character meanings that lack internal connection, creating a sense of fragmentation</li>
                <li><strong>Emphasize holistic sense: </strong>A name should be considered as a whole, not simply a pile of characters</li>
                <li><strong>Consider contemporary features: </strong>The integration of form and meaning in names should respect tradition while conforming to contemporary aesthetics</li>

          <p>With the development of the times, the concept of Form and Meaning Integration is constantly innovating and expanding, presenting some new trends and characteristics.</p>
          
          <div class="contemporary-wrapper">
            <div class="contemporary-card">
              <h3>Minimalist Aesthetics (简约美学)</h3>
              <p>Contemporary names tend toward a minimalist aesthetic that is simple but not simplistic:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Streamlined character forms: </strong>Tendency to choose characters with moderate strokes and clear structures</li>
                <li><strong>Beauty of white space: </strong>Attention to spatial relationships between character forms, emphasizing appropriate density</li>
                <li><strong>Concise expression: </strong>Expressing rich connotations through minimalist character forms</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the name "晨曦" (Chen Xi), both characters have left-right structures but different internal constructions, moderate stroke counts, minimalist and elegant form, with bright and beautiful imagery.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contemporary-card">
              <h3>Cross-cultural Considerations (跨文化考量)</h3>
              <p>In the context of globalization, Form and Meaning Integration in names also needs to consider cross-cultural factors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>International recognizability: </strong>Choosing characters that are easily recognized and remembered by non-Chinese speakers</li>
                <li><strong>Translation friendliness: </strong>Considering whether the meaning and beauty of the name are preserved after translation</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural fusion: </strong>Maintaining Chinese cultural characteristics while accommodating an international perspective</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the name "雨桐" (Yu Tong) has clear character forms and moderate stroke counts, making it easy to write and recognize in international settings; its meaning is beautiful, expressing natural beauty, with no cross-cultural barriers to understanding.</p>
