            <p>Characters from classical texts are an important source in traditional Chinese naming theory, referring to the selection of characters with profound cultural connotations from ancient classics, poetry, and prose for naming. This naming approach not only endows names with rich cultural heritage and aesthetic value but also reflects a family's cultural expectations and spiritual aspirations for their children.</p>

          <h2>Methods and Techniques of Naming from Classics (典籍取名方法与技巧)</h2>
          <p>There are various methods and techniques for selecting characters from ancient classics for naming. Below are some common naming strategies.</p>
          
          <div class="method-wrapper">
            <div class="method-card">
              <h3>Direct Quotation Method (直接引用法)</h3>
              <p>Directly extract single characters or phrases from classic works for naming:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Character Extraction (单字提取): </strong>Select a character with special meaning from poetic sentences, such as the character "白" (white) in "李白" (Li Bai) from the Analects' "白圭之玷，尚可磨也" (a white jade with a flaw can still be polished)</li>
                <li><strong>Phrase Extraction (词组提取): </strong>Select two or more consecutive characters from classic works, such as "子墨" (Zi Mo) from the Analects' "子墨子言俭" (Master Mo spoke of frugality)</li>
                <li><strong>Allusion Names (典故名): </strong>Directly use key characters from allusions for naming, such as "子期" (Zi Qi) from the story of Boya and Ziqi's friendship</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the character "亮" (bright) in Zhuge Liang's name comes from the meaning of "昭" (shine) in the Book of Songs' "文王在上，於昭于天" (King Wen is above, shining in heaven), indicating brightness and prominence.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="method-card">
              <h3>Imagery Extraction Method (意境提取法)</h3>
              <p>Rather than directly quoting the original text, this method distills its imagery or theme:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Imagery Transformation (意境转化): </strong>Transform the imagery of poetry into a name, such as "月明" (Bright Moon) derived from the imagery of "月出照兮，佼人僚兮" (the moon comes out and shines, beautiful is the person)</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Distillation (主题提炼): </strong>Extract naming elements from the theme of literary works, such as "志远" (Lofty Aspiration) from the theme of "志当存高远" (one's aspiration should aim high)</li>
                <li><strong>Image Creation (形象塑造): </strong>Create names based on images depicted in literary works, such as "松雪" (Pine and Snow) based on the image of pine trees standing proudly in snow</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the name "清风" (Pure Wind) may not directly quote a specific line of poetry, but it embodies the commonly seen imagery of "清风徐来" (gentle pure breeze comes) in poetry.</p>

          <h2>Classical Characters and Modern Life (典籍用字与现代生活)</h2>
          <p>In modern society, how can we combine the wisdom from ancient classics with modern life to infuse contemporary naming with new vitality?</p>
          
          <div class="modern-wrapper">
            <div class="modern-card">
              <h3>Integration of Tradition and Modernity (传统与现代的融合)</h3>
              <p>How characters from ancient classics can be combined with modern values and lifestyles:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Modern Interpretation (现代解读): </strong>Give modern interpretations to classical concepts, such as understanding "德" (virtue) as the sense of morality and responsibility in modern society</li>
                <li><strong>Value Updates (价值观更新): </strong>Select classical concepts that align with modern core values, such as "和" (harmony), "合" (unity), "共" (togetherness) that emphasize harmonious coexistence</li>
                <li><strong>Old and New Combination (新旧结合): </strong>Combine classical terms with modern terms, such as combining "明哲" (classical, meaning wise and discerning) with "创新" (modern, meaning innovation)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, the name "雨桐" (Yu Tong), where "雨" (rain) is taken from the ancient poem "好雨知时节，当春乃发生" (good rain knows the best season and comes in spring), and "桐" (paulownia) connects with modern environmental awareness, exemplifying the fusion of tradition and modernity.</p>

              <h3>Contemporary Value of Classical Naming (典籍命名的当代价值)</h3>
              <p>The unique value and significance of classical naming in contemporary society:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural Inheritance (文化传承): </strong>Pass down excellent traditional Chinese culture through names, enhancing cultural confidence and identity</li>
                <li><strong>Spiritual Aspiration (精神寄托): </strong>In today's materially abundant world, names carry the pursuit and yearning for spiritual values</li>
                <li><strong>Expression of Individuality (个性表达): </strong>In a modern society where names are similar, characters from classics can highlight unique personal taste and cultural accomplishment</li>
                <li><strong>Family Expectations (家族期望): </strong>Express family expectations and blessings for the next generation through classical naming, continuing the family spirit</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For example, famous director Zhang Yimou named his daughter "张末" (Zhang Mo), taking from the Tao Te Ching's "知其白，守其黑，为天下式。为天下式，常德不忒，复归于无极" (knowing the white, maintaining the black, becoming the model for the world. Being the model for the world, constant virtue will not fail, returning to the infinite), reflecting the modern inheritance of the Taoist thought of "returning to simplicity."</p>
