            <h2>Overview of Sound Harmony (音韵和谐概述)</h2>
            <p>Sound Harmony (音韵和谐) is an important component of traditional Chinese naming theory, emphasizing the beauty and harmony in the pronunciation of names, including tonal variations, syllable combinations, and overall phonetic fluency. It is an art of naming that combines linguistics and aesthetics, aiming to create names that are pleasing to the ear and rich in meaning through careful phonetic design.</p>
            <p>Throughout China's thousands of years of naming culture, Sound Harmony has always been considered one of the key standards of a good name. Since ancient times, people have emphasized "beautiful sound, deep meaning" (音美意深), seeking perfect unity between phonetic beauty and meaningful connotations in names. Especially among scholars and literati, the phonetic beauty of names was regarded as a reflection of cultural cultivation.</p>

          <h2>The Beauty of Tones (声调之美)</h2>
          <p>Chinese is a typical tonal language, with different tones giving words different meanings and emotional qualities. In the tonal arrangement of names, there is an emphasis on alternating level and oblique tones (平仄相间) and creating rhythmic undulation (抑扬有致) to achieve sound harmony.</p>

              <h3>Basics of Chinese Tones (汉语声调基础)</h3>
              <p>Mandarin Chinese has four basic tones and one neutral tone:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>First Tone (阴平): </strong>High and level, as in "诗, 天, 言" (pitch contour: ➖)</li>
                <li><strong>Second Tone (阳平): </strong>Rising from mid to high, as in "时, 田, 颜" (pitch contour: ➗)</li>
                <li><strong>Third Tone (上声): </strong>Falling then rising, as in "史, 展, 彦" (pitch contour: ✓)</li>
                <li><strong>Fourth Tone (去声): </strong>Falling from high to low, as in "是, 典, 焱" (pitch contour: ➘)</li>
                <li><strong>Neutral Tone (轻声): </strong>Short and light, as in "的, 了, 吗" (pitch depends on the preceding syllable)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tone-card">
              <h3>Principles of Tone Combinations (声调组合原则)</h3>
              <p>Ideal tone combinations for two-character names (surname + given name):</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Level-Level Combination (平平组合): </strong>Such as "王明" (Wang Ming, both 2nd tone), suitable for expressing steadiness and grandeur</li>
                <li><strong>Level-Oblique Combination (平仄组合): </strong>Such as "李强" (Li Qiang, 3rd + 2nd tone), rich in variation with rhythmic undulation</li>
                <li><strong>Oblique-Level Combination (仄平组合): </strong>Such as "张伟" (Zhang Wei, 1st + 3rd tone), first high then low, harmonious and stable</li>
                <li><strong>Oblique-Oblique Combination (仄仄组合): </strong>Such as "陈杰" (Chen Jie, both 2nd tone), emphasizing momentum but needing to avoid monotony</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Ideal tone combinations for three-character names (double surname or single surname + two-character given name):</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Level-Level-Oblique (平平仄): </strong>Such as "王小明" (Wang Xiaoming, 2nd + 3rd + 2nd tone), overall stable with variation</li>
                <li><strong>Level-Oblique-Level (平仄平): </strong>Such as "李文涛" (Li Wentao, 3rd + 2nd + 1st tone), middle fluctuation with beginning and end echoing each other</li>
                <li><strong>Oblique-Level-Oblique (仄平仄): </strong>Such as "张伟光" (Zhang Weiguang, 1st + 3rd + 1st tone), cyclical phonetics with rhythmic sense</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>Syllable Combinations and Rhythm (音节搭配与韵律)</h2>
          <p>Besides tones, the combination of syllables, harmony of vowels, and overall rhythmic feel are also important aspects of sound harmony.</p>
          
          <div class="phonetics-wrapper">
            <div class="phonetics-card">
              <h3>Vowel Harmony (韵母协调)</h3>
              <p>Vowels are the core part of Chinese character pronunciation and affect the musicality of names. Principles for coordinating vowels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Similar Vowel Pairing (同韵相配): </strong>Using characters with the same or similar vowels, such as "华夏" (Hua Xia, ua-ia), can create a sense of cyclical beauty</li>
                <li><strong>Complementary Vowel Pairing (异韵互补): </strong>Combining different vowels, such as "博雅" (Bo Ya, o-a), adds variation while maintaining harmony</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Monotonous Repetition (避免重复单调): </strong>Avoid using overly similar vowels that create monotonous sounds, such as the nasal vowels in "明星" (Ming Xing)</li>
                <li><strong>Harmonious Transition (和谐过渡): </strong>Adjacent characters' vowels should have a natural transition, avoiding too strong a sense of phonetic jumping</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="phonetics-card">
              <h3>Consonant Harmony (声母和谐)</h3>
              <p>The choice of consonants also affects the phonetic effect of names:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Repetitive Consonants (避免重复声母): </strong>Such as "通天" (Tong Tian), both with tongue-tip sounds, making pronunciation fluid but lacking variation</li>
                <li><strong>Attention to Articulation Position (注意发音部位): </strong>Adjacent characters' consonants should vary in articulation position, such as "金玉" (Jin Yu, velar k-sound + zero initial)</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination of Tone and Consonant (声调与声母配合): </strong>Voiced consonants (such as m, n, l) are suitable for pairing with level tones to increase softness</li>
                <li><strong>Variation in Stress (轻重音变化): </strong>Plosive sounds (such as b, p, d) combined with other phonemes can create rhythmic undulation</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Different consonant combinations can create different phonetic effects:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Soft Type (柔和型): </strong>Primarily using m, n, l, y, w, such as "梦瑶" (Meng Yao), "灵雨" (Ling Yu)</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Type (刚健型): </strong>Primarily using b, p, d, t, g, k, such as "博达" (Bo Da), "刚毅" (Gang Yi)</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Type (平衡型): </strong>Combining strength and softness, such as "明亮" (Ming Liang), "立恒" (Li Heng)</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages of Three-Sound Characters (三音字优势): </strong>Three-syllable Chinese characters (such as "玥, 晔, 烨") often have more beautiful phonetic effects</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Difficult Pronunciations (避免难发音): </strong>Avoid using characters with complex or awkward pronunciations, such as characters with multiple consonant initials (like "嚅, 戳")</li>
                <li><strong>Considering Homophone Effects (考虑谐音效应): </strong>Pay attention to the homophone relationships between names and other words, avoiding inappropriate or negative associations</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Phonetic Differences (地域音韵差异): </strong>Consider pronunciation characteristics in different dialect regions, choosing names that sound pleasant in multiple dialects</li>
                <li><strong>Considering Name Length (考虑名字长度): </strong>Single-character, double-character, or multi-character names require different phonetic balance considerations</li>

                <li><strong>Alternating Level and Oblique Tones (平仄交替): </strong>Such as the "level-level-oblique-oblique-level" pattern in five-character regulated verse, which can create rhythmic undulation when applied to naming</li>

                <li><strong>Parallel Structure (对仗手法): </strong>The parallel structure in poetry emphasizes the symmetrical beauty of sound and character form, particularly suitable for two-character names</li>
                <li><strong>Metrical Structure (音步结构): </strong>The metrical structure in poetry can guide the arrangement of syllable length in names</li>

                <li><strong>Progressive Type (层递型): </strong>"李白" (Li Bai, 3rd+2nd tone), rising from low to high, like the beginning technique often seen in Tang poetry</li>
                <li><strong>Encircling Type (环绕型): </strong>"周恩来" (Zhou Enlai, 1st+1st+2nd tone), level tones surrounding the middle level tone, creating a sense of stability</li>
